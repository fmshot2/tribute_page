          <li>1933 - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program
            known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
          <li>1935 - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping
            starving

          <li>1937 - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service
          </li>
          <li>1938 - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin
